## Summary
This app is my first step to becoming a programmer and its exciting!

I learned quite a lot of the new ES6 JavaScript syntax as well as some new concepts pertaining to descriptive naming of variables and functions. On a lighter yet functional level, I learned how to calculate time and account for the time difference between military and standard time. I had a lot of fun working on this minimalist digital clock App.
